# Titanic_data_preprocessing

### Project Description: Preprocessing the Titanic Dataset
#### Objective:

The goal of this project is to clean, preprocess, and prepare the Titanic dataset for machine learning models. The dataset contains information about the passengers of the Titanic, and the primary aim is to predict whether a passenger survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and other personal details.

#### Dataset Overview:

##### The Titanic dataset is a classic dataset from the Kaggle competition, containing the following columns:

##### PassengerId: Unique identifier for each passenger.
##### Survived: Binary variable indicating survival (1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive).
##### Pclass: Passenger class (1st, 2nd, 3rd).
##### Name: Passenger name.
##### Sex: Gender of the passenger.
##### Age: Age of the passenger.
##### SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard the Titanic.
##### Parch: Number of parents/children aboard the Titanic.
##### Ticket: Ticket number.
##### Fare: Fare paid for the ticket.
##### Cabin: Cabin number.
##### Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton).
